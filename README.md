## What you need to know about this repository and its code
First off, it should be noted that a great effort was made to javadoc and otherwise comment as much of the code as possible. This should make reading the code significantly easier.

Additionally, if you need to understand this code in order to repair this robot some time in the future, check out the releases section. There, you can find snapshots of the code in its know working states from various times throughout 2017, and maybe you will be able to simply deploy the code with no hastle.
